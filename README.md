# Field Inspection Review Management System (aka FIRMS)

TO DO: Our project description. 

## Getting Started

These instructions are based on http://meanjs.org/generator.html, except some details have been modified to fix the incompatibility issues of the official tutorial with the latest Node/NPM releases.

### Versions

Below are the versions needed for our project:

```
Node: v12.16.1
NPM: 6.13.4
MEAN: Master
```

### Prerequisites

Required Packages:

```
$ npm install -g yo
$ npm install -g generator-meanjs
$ npm install -g bower
$ npm install -g gulp
```

### Installing

After installing the Required Packages, follow the steps below to get the project running. 

STEP 1:

```
$ yo meanjs
```
At the Prompt, "What mean.js version would you like to generate? (Use arrow keys)", select the version "Master"

NOTES: 
- This is extremely important, as Master is the only one that works. The rest of the other versions of mean.js are incompatible with the latest versions of Node and NPM.

- If you are unable to toggle values using the arrow keys, try using a different terminal. 
    - MingW64 (comes with GIT) doesn't seem to be supported.
    - For Windows, CMD or the Linux Sub-system Terminal.
    - For Ubuntu, the default terminal.
    - For Mac, the default erminal.

STEP 2:

```
$ gulp
```
NOTE:
- Master Version DOES NOT use GRUNT to run the server, as the previous versions! It uses GULP instead. The official documentation does not mention this, oddly enough.

STEP 3:
The server should now be up and running at localhost:3000.
